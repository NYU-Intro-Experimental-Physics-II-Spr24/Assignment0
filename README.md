# Assignment0

This read me and associated assignment are adapted from [Jeremey Manning's Psych 32 Assignment Hello, World!](github.com/ContextLab/psyc32-hello-world/) and from [NYUExperimentalPhysics1-2021/Assignment0
](github.com/NYU-IEP-2022-2023-Assignments/Assignment0).

This is a template repository for **Intro Experimental Physics II Assignment 0**. We will be using Google Colaboratory and Github Classroom to submit Python assignments in this course. In this assignment we will go through the steps of opening, editing, saving, and submitting your code.  

# Setup
First, you will need access to Google Drive and Github. You can use the Google Drive associated with your nyu.edu email address. If you do not already have a Github account, you will need to create one. 

All of the assignment instructions are in the Jupyter (.ipynb) notebook. To begin, open (click) the `Assignment0.ipynb` notebook and then click on the blue "Open in Colab" button at the top. A new tab or window should open in your browser, displaying the notebook in Google Colaboratory.

In order to submit your assignment **you'll need to save an editable copy of your notebook**. (You cannot save changes to the original version of the notebook.) Click File > Save a copy in Drive and then save your copy of the notebook as `Assignment0.ipynb` (i.e., remove the "`Copy of`" text that gets automatically appended to the beginning of the filename).

The second setup task is to ensure that Colaboratory has access to your private repositories on GitHub.  (By default, your assignment repositories will be accessible only to you and the course instructor.) To give Colaboratory access to your private repositories:
- Navigate to [http://colab.research.google.com/github](http://colab.research.google.com/github)
- Make sure the "Include Private Repos" checkbox is checked
- In the popup window, sign into your GitHub account and authorize Colab to read private files

You should do your work on the assignment in the *copied* notebook (i.e., the copied notebook that you have the ability to save and edit).  

# Submit
Submitting the assignment entails syncing your copy of the notebook with your GitHub repository (in this case, `NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24/Assignment0-<username>`, with `<username>` replaced with your GitHub username).  From within Colaboratory, open your notebook and click File > Save a copy in GitHub.  Select `NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24/Assignment0-<username>` from the Repository drop-down menu, and type '`Assignment0.ipynb`' into the File path text box.  Optionally, you may also enter a description into the "Commit message" text box (or you can just leave the default message).  Make sure that the "Include a link to Colaboratory" box is checked, and press "OK".  A new tab or window should open up, displaying your submitted notebook from within your GitHub repository.

Before leaving the lab, confirm with your laboratory instructor that they can see your submitted work. You will follow the same procedure to submit future Python assignments in this course, so make sure you can correctly follow these steps now!
